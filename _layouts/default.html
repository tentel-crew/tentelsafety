    <h3>TentelSafety - there is a security bot. All its functions and configurations are focused specifically on ensuring the security of the Discord server.

One of TentelSafety's main advantages is its ability to detect and remove malicious integrations that other AntiNuke bots might miss. TentelSafety scans the server in real time, which allows you to detect and remove malicious integrations when they appear on the server.
      
TentelSafety has several server security methods that can be enabled for free through the t.safety security algorithms configurator
      
TentelSafety removes a Malicious Bot in one second (500 milliseconds on average)</h3>
